   - get_accommodation(city, accommodation_type)
   - get_travel_advisory(city)

2. Extract accommodation price per night from the accommodation tool response. If multiple prices exist, use the average or median price.

3. Call cost estimation tools:
   - estimate_hotel_cost(price_per_night, duration, travelers)
   - estimate_daily_expenses(trip_type, travelers, interests)
   - calculate_total_expense(hotel_cost, daily_expenses)
   - convert_currency(amount=total_expense, from_currency, to_currency)
   - calculate_daily_budget(total_cost_in_to_currency, duration)

4. Prepare a detailed final trip plan including:
   - Current weather and 3-day forecast with temperatures and rain chances.
   - Top attractions with addresses.
   - Accommodation options and average nightly price.
   - Travel advisories and safety information.
   - Budget estimates with actual numeric values for:
     * Hotel cost (total for stay)
     * Daily expenses estimate (total for stay)
     * Total estimated trip cost (hotel + daily)
     * Converted total cost into the requested currency
     * Average daily budget in the converted currency

5. Format the final output clearly and conversationally, including emojis for friendly tone.
